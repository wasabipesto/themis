    Calibration is a very simple metric at its core. If a market's listed
    probability is at 70%, we should expect it to resolve YES about 70% of the
    time. For all past markets, we can look at the market's midpoint probability
    and compare it to the end result. If those numbers match, we say the
    platform is well-calibrated. If they don't, there may be some systemic
    reason why forecasters routinely under- or over-estimate the odds.
  </div>
  <div class="mt-2">
    While calibration is focused on how your predictions match reality, accuracy
    is focused on how often you were correct. The main accuracy score we use
    here is the Brier score, which compares the prediction (usually at the
    market's midpoint) with the resolution at the end of the market. The thing
    to remember is that the Brier score meausres how far off you are, meaning
    that a lower score is actaully better!

      The closer we are to an event, we should expect that the more accuract the
      forecasts will be. For one, traders will be more likely to invest in the
      market due to a shorter time to return, giving the market more liquidity.
      Two, we will presumably have more information about the upcoming event,
      such as polls, research, and generally reduced uncertainty.

      This seems to be mostly backed up by the plot below. Kalshi and Manifold
      have a gradually decreasing score (lower is better) starting around 6
      months before resolution. Metaculus, which does not rely on liquidity,
      shows a similar but smaller change. However, for Polymarket you'll notice
      a large uptick instead - this is due to the fact that most of their
      markets are very short-term. What you're actually seeing is a very low
      sample size for most of those data points, since only 10% of their markets
      are longer than 50 days.
    </div>
    <div class="my-2">
      Similarly to above, it is often noted that a large number of traders or
      high volume signifies a higher expected market accuracy. A proper test of
      this hypothesis would need to control for variables that we do not have,
      bt we can at least see if our unfiltered samples show a correlation in
      this way. Note that several of these datapoints have a low number of
      sample markets, and any with less than 10 in the sample were excluded.

      culture, some is based on how the platform is designed, and some is just
      based on marketing strategy. We try to automatically categorize all
      markets into our standard set, but how do the distributions turn out per
      platform?
