# Project Themis

This is a work-in-progress rewrite of [Calibration City](https://github.com/wasabipesto/calibration-site), a prediction market scoring site. Project Themis includes a number of upgrades and changes to the original concept, such as:

- Orders of magnitude faster, thanks to a complete rewrite in rust! API calls to the v1 backend would take up to 15 seconds, while the new version handles hundreds of thousands of markets in under half a second.
- Supports multiple prediction platforms! Now you can have a direct comparison across platforms with simultaneous filters and weights to modify the calibration plots and Brier scores.
- Much nicer user interface! Upgraded from an HTML form with no documentation, now each option has an explanation and live-updating selectors.

## How it works

We have three subprojects here: `fetch`, `serve`, and `client`. Fetch and serve are written in rust, and they save markets to or query markets from the database respectively. Client is a simple webpage to hit the serve API and show the results.

### Fetch

In `fetch`, we have a library `lib` that holds the basic logic and `main` that serves it as a CLI with intelligent argument parsing. The valid arguments can be found in the serve README or `themis-fetch --help`. The `platform` module has type definitions, reused functions, and default trait implementations. Each sub-module has platform-specific download and parsing functions. Adding new platforms is fairly straightforward as long as the trait implementations are satisfied.

In the default flow we spin up a group of async tasks to recursively download all markets on each platform and then sub-tasks to get additional information like bets and market history. Each platform has an independent ratelimit and deserializes immediately into typed structs upon response. We insert markets into the database or update if they already exist, printing errors to the console but largely skipping recoverable or row-specific faults.

### Serve

Subproject `serve` queries an external Postgres database with saved markets, calculates calibration points and Brier score, and ships it off to the client. Right now it only has a single route but it is extremely fast, usually completing a request in under 250ms. You can find the API schema in the serve README.

### Client

The `client` subproject is actually just a single HTML file that pulls a few scripts via CDN to build the layout and then queries the `serve` API to get data.

## Implementation details

When standardizing things across platforms we ran into some edge cases, I've tried to detail them all here. When in doubt, you can always check the source to see how we compute a specific attribute.

### All
- To calculate `prob_time_weighted`, we assume the market opens at 50%. Once the first trade occurs, we track the probability at each trade and the cumulative durations to generate an average.

### Kalshi
- We use the YES price from the most recently executed trade as the probability at any point in time.
- The counter for `num_traders` is currently unimplemented.
- Supported market types:
    - [x] Binary

### Manifold
- Supported market types: 
    - [x] CPMM-1 Binary
    - [ ] CPMM-1 Pseudo-Numeric
    - [ ] CPMM-1 Multiple-Choice Unlinked
    - [ ] CPMM-1 Multiple-Choice Linked
    - [ ] DPM-2 Binary

### Metaculus
- We use the `community_prediction.history.x2.avg` series for the probability
- Since Metaculus does not have bets, we use the number of forecasts at 10 cents each for `volume_usd`
- Supported market types: 
    - [x] Binary

### Polymarket
- Getting resolution data is quite difficult due to the oracle resolution process. Since markets never close (traders just redeem their tokens for USDC) then they stabilize at the extremes pretty consistently - 96% of all closed markets were trading at less than $0.0001 from an extreme. Some markets sit at 50/50 - these likely had no activity at all. If we filter markets to just those trading at less than $0.0001 from an extreme, we can be confident they have been resolved in that direction.
- Many markets (around 22%) lack `startDate` and around 1% lack `endDate`, and both of those are merely suggestions. `createdAt` is mandatory on all markets, and it is usually less than five days before `startDate` (when present). For our market open and close times, we use `startDate` when it is available and `createdAt` when it is not.
- The counter for `num_traders` is currently unimplemented.
- Supported market types:
    - [x] Two-outcome linked
    - [ ] Two-outcome unlinked
    - [ ] More than two outcomes
We also do not support old markets that used a previous order system, only those that use the newer CLOB system.

## Roadmap

### Fetch
- Hardcode maps of site categories to standard categories
- Add error importance, hide low importance, eprint on medium, and panic on high

#### Kalshi
- Investigate getting the number of unique traders
- Investigate additional market types

#### Manifold
- Investigate including linked and unlinked multiple choice

#### Metaculus
- Investigate additional market types

#### Polymarket
- Investigate getting the number of unique traders
- Investigate including linked and unlinked multiple choice

### Serve
- Compute log score (maybe with transformation)
- Add optional KDE smoothing to calibration

### Client
- Add a dedicated explainer page with a walkthough on calibration
- Add a way to share a link to the current view with weights & filters
- Investigate mobile support: dragging slider moves sidebar, can't re-enter sidebar
- Investigate swapping out plotly for a custom D3 component

### Other
- Investigate PredictIt
- Save open & close times to the database and add client filter
- Set up docker container for client and a sample compose file
- Return a list of markets in each sample
- Plot Brier score against any x-axis (closed date, number of traders, market volume)
- Investigate a standardized corpus of questions across platforms

I use Manifold much more than any of the other platforms included in this analysis, and have received bounties from the Manifold team in both mana (play money) and real money. Their contributions did not affect the contents of this site in any way.
