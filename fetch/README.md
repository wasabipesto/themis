# themis-fetch

This is the backend service that downloads data from each platform and saves it to a database for querying later. 

## Usage

```
  -p, --platform <PLATFORM>  Override the default platform list to only pull from one provider
      --id <ID>              Only pull market data for a single market - requires a single platform to be specified
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>      Where to redirect the output [default: database] [possible values: database, stdout]
  -v, --verbose              Show additional output for debugging
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```

## Platforms

### Stage 1.

These should be platforms that have an established presence and an open API. I would like to have 5 sites for the MVP.

    - Past project: https://github.com/kiernann/predelect
    - Internal API: https://www.predictit.org/api/Public/GetMarketChartData

### Stage 2.

After the MVP is established we can show off the project to get API access to other sites. These should be sites with larger volumes or different userbases.

- [ ] Betfair
    - https://www.betfair.com
    - Mainly in sports with some UK politics.
    - Secret API endpoint? No documentation.
- [ ] Futuur

    - https://api.futuur.com/docs
    - Both play money & real money versions.
- [ ] Hypermind
    - https://www.hypermind.com
    - General prediction market and aggregation site.
    - Seems to have good history.
    - Does not appear to have an API.
- [ ] Insight
    - https://insightprediction.com
    - API: https://insightprediction.com/api/markets
    - General market site with high volume.
    - No public API documentation? Taken offline?

### Stage 3.

Same as stage 2 but with lower-volume or otherwise lower-priority sites.

    - https://augur.net
    - Crypto-based smart contracts on Ethereum.
    - Website completely inaccessible from the US.

    - Does not appear to have an API.

### Tentative

Sites that I may add at some point in the future but don't currently seem worth it.
